                <b>Research Interests</b> <br>
                I am interested in developing and analyzing statistical algorithms for non-standard data such as: networks, text, images, and multi-view data. My research draws on stochastic processes, high dimensional statistics, deep learning, and optimization. The scientific questions driving my work come from:the law, natural language processing, genetics, histopathology and medical imaging.

                <b>Brief Bio</b> <br>
                I will be starting as an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1902440&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow</a> at the University of Washington, hosted by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/">Daniela Witten</a> in the summer of 2019. I am currently finishing my PhD in Statistics at the <a href="http://stat-or.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> where I am advised by <a href="https://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu/">Shankar Bhamidi</a> and <a href="https://marron.web.unc.edu/">J.S Marron</a>. Before coming to North Carolina I majored in math and physics at Cornell University.

                <br>
                <br>
                I am committed to making modern, computational methodologies more accessible to statisticians and scientists, as well as those without a traditional STEM background. With funding from <a href="https://data.web.unc.edu/">Data@Carolina</a> (and a lot of <a href="https://idc9.github.io/stor390/course_info/acknowledgments.html">help</a>) I created and taught the first data science course offered by UNC's statistics department (<a href="https://idc9.github.io/stor390/">STOR 390: Introduction to Data Science</a>) which is now a permanent part of the curriculum.
