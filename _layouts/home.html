                <b>Brief Bio</b> <br>
                I am a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1902440&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow</a> at the University of Washington, hosted by <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/">Daniela Witten</a>. I completed my PhD in Statistics at the <a href="http://stat-or.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu/">Shankar Bhamidi</a> and <a href="https://marron.web.unc.edu/">J.S Marron</a>. During my PhD I created and taught the <a href="https://idc9.github.io/stor390/">first data science</a> course offered by UNC's statistics department which is now a permant part of the curriculum. Before UNC I majored in math and physics at Cornell University.

                <b>Research Interests</b> <br>
                My reserach is broadly about developing and analyzing statistical algorithms for multiple, complex modalities of data such as networks, text, images and high-dimensional, multi-view data. The scientific questions driving my work come from: the law, computational neuroscience, breast cancer pathology and medical imaging. In addition to research, I am also committed to making modern, computational methodologies more accessible to statisticians and scientists, as well as those without a traditional STEM background.
