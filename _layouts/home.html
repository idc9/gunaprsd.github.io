                <b>Brief Bio</b> <br>
                I am currently supported by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1902440&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowship</a> hosted by Prof. <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/">Daniela Witten</a> at the University of Washington, Seattle. Previously, I completed my PhD in Statistics under Prof. <a href="https://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu/">Shankar Bhamidi</a> and Prof. <a href="https://marron.web.unc.edu/">J.S Marron</a> at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Before that, I received a BS in Math and Physics from Cornell University.
                <br><br>

                <b>Research Interests</b> <br>
                My interests are developing new methods, theory, and computational approaches for complex modalities of data including networks, images and multi-view data. I am especially interested in data integration problems, which explore how information is shared across multiple data modalities. The scientific questions driving my work come from computational pathology, computational neuroscience, genetics and law.
                <br><br>

                In addition to research, I am committed to making modern, computational methods more accessible to statisticians and scientists, as well as those without a traditional STEM background. During my time at UNC I created and taught the first <a href="https://idc9.github.io/stor390/">data science course</a> offered by the Statistics Department, which is now a permanent part of the curriculum.
