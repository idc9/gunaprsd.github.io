                <b>Research Interests</b> <br>
                I am interested in developing and analyzing statistical algorithms for non-standard data such as: networks, text, and high-dimensional data. My research draws on probability, optimization, and statistics/machine learning and is currently driven by problems from neuroscience and the law.

                <b>Brief Bio</b> <br>
                I am a graduate student in Statistics at the <a href="http://stat-or.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> where I am co-advised by <a href="https://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu/">Shankar Bhamidi</a> and <a href="https://marron.web.unc.edu/">J.S Marron</a>. Before coming to North Carolina I studied math and physics at Cornell University where I graduated in 2014 (Cum Laude). As an undergraduate I worked on the <a href="https://cusat.cornell.edu/engieering">CuSat</a> engineering project team and in a bio-phyiscs lab led by <a href="http://franckgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/research">Carl Franck</a>. Over summer 2016 I interned for <a href="https://gamalon.com/">Gamalon</a>, a Bayesian machine learning startup. In addition to research I consult with <a href="https://www.reesenewslab.org/">Reese News Lab</a> on a variety of data driven journalism projects.
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition to my research, I believe in making data science and the ability to reason about data more accessible to people without an advanced degree or even a traditional STEM background. This means teaching a practical focused combination of programming (R/Python), statistics, and communication skills. With funding from <a href="https://data.web.unc.edu/">Data@Carolina</a> and a lot of <a href="https://idc9.github.io/stor390/course_info/acknowledgments.html">help</a> I developed <a href="https://idc9.github.io/stor390/">STOR 390: Introduction to Data Science</a>.
