I recently gave a tutorial on getting started with word embeddings in Python to a digital humanities group.  The tutorial covers material from [15 (vector semantics)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/15.pdf) and [16 (semantics with dense vectors)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/16.pdf) from [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/). The data set is ~30,000 Supreme Court opinions provided by [CourtListener](https://www.courtlistener.com/). The repository comes with a small data set loaded and instructions for getting more data from CourtListener.

You can find the tutorial/instructions/additional resources at: [**https://github.com/idc9/word_embed_tutorial**](https://github.com/idc9/word_embed_tutorial)
